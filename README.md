# Rank It

We are here to help you create and rank a list of anything from favorite music to judging a chili competition.

What makes us better at it than everyone else, is we don't rely on inconsistent star rating systems, or point systems. We simply the process and force the evaluator to pick their favorite of two options in the list. Based on the comparisons we score each entry in the list which allows us to rank each entry.

## Stories
